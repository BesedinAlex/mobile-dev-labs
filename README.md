# "Mobile-development" labs

On the "Mobile-development" discipline we had to learn how to make cross-platform apps with FireMonkey Pascal/C++ Framework in Rad Studio.

We actually made a ton of simple apps but most of them were simply copy-pasted lessons (that's actually what we had to do in entire semester).

Here I keep 3 projects that were individual tasks and made entirely by myself.

## Individual Projects:
1. Concentration game. A copy of [game project from Stanford Lectures](https://github.com/BesedinAlex/concentration) that I made some time ago. Was re-written with C++ and FireMonkey.
2. ToDoList. A simple ToDoList with connection to SQLite database. To-Do Task can have sub-tasks, so can sub-tasks themselves (sub-sub-tasks I guess :D).
3. 15-Puzzle game. Simple [15-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) game. *Unfinished for a moment*.
4. Memory training game. A simple memory game with few settings and variations. It was an exam task so it's a bit messy but it does what needed so it's good for me.
